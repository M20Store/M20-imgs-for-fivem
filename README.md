ðŸ‘‹ **Welcome to my GitHub!**

I'm a dedicated FiveM developer specializing in custom server scripting and modding. With a strong foundation in the **qb-core framework**, I build immersive experiences for players, including custom scripts for trading systems, warehouses, inventory management, and more. I integrate **JavaScript, Lua, and HTML/CSS** to create seamless interactions and enhanced game mechanics.

ðŸš€ **What I Offer:**
- Customizable scripts for unique server experiences
- Expertise with **qb-inventory**, **qb-target**, **ox_lib**, and **qb-menu** for optimized gameplay
- Focus on **robbery systems**, **warehouse functionality**, **item spawning**, and **trade systems**
- Discord bot integration for community management and subscription systems

Iâ€™m passionate about pushing the limits of FiveM to create interactive, enjoyable servers. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or need help with FiveM projects!
